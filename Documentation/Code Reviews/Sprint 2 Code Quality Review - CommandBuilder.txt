Code Quality:
This code is very straightforward and high quality. The class builds many Command objects and registers them to different keyboard keys. 
It does not do any other unspecified jobs so it is very clear from the title what it does. It is scalable and will make it easy to 
bind different commands to different inputs in the future.

Hypothetical change:
A dictionary could maybe be used to map keys to their commands so that keyboard.RegisterCommand() isn't repeated so much, but this probably
isn't necessary since you would replace all of the RegisterCommand calls with dictionary.Add().
