Class Reviewed: Dodongo.cs

Time: 27 minutes

Code Quality:
I think that the code is relatively readable, with sections split up in ways that would be expected.
The class is getting close to the limit for length, but it is still within the limits. The Update method seems a little on the longer side.
Maybe some parts of the logic (for example, taking damage or changing direction randomly) could be put in methods that are for that single purpose.
It looks like you have a lot of logic in this class, which makes me wonder if it would be more beneficial to take some of it out and put it as part of the states.
I like that your class takes advantage of the sprite factory for drawing sprites, making it easier if some of that would need to be modified later.


Hypothetical Change:
A hyopthetical change for this class would be to have the Dodoongo do some sort of specific move (such walking in a specific pattern like a box or a figure 8), 
where it would have to change directions in a specific way instead of randomly. I think it wouldn't be too difficult to add this as a possibility, although
the class uses a lot of random logic to determine where it moves. Adding this logic would likely push the class over the limit for class length. It would
probably be able to use some of the methods already present, along with a timer to determine how long it walks in each direction to switch instead of the
random switching, making it a relatively easy change to make.
