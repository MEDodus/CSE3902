Sprint #: 2
Class Reviewed: Link2
Author: Nicholas Younoszai
Time: 43min.

Code Quality:
This code is very readable and keeps within the suggest class and method lengths. 
The class is highly cohesive as each method only makes one call to a method in the LinkeState classes.
The code moderate cohesion since it is is dependent on each of the Link state classes. However, this is a result of using the state pattern.
It might be beneficial to use some constants instead of references to magic numbers in the class.

Hypothetical Change:
One thing this class does not take into account is a state where Link takes too much damage and dies.  This is not implemented within the DamagedLink
class either when the damage is applied. It might be beneficial to add another state so that if link does sustain too much damage, his sprite will 
disapear and the game will end.
