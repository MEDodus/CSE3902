Class Reviewed: Projectile
Time: 30min

Code Quality:
The code is highly readable, it has virtual updateAdditional class to update sprite,
and clearly initialized the impotant parameters like pixelsPerSecond, velocity, and etc.
The logic of the code is very beautiful, I never thought it could be such a way to make 
it work. In a bigger view, the interface make the projectileStorage and the classes for 
specific items like Arrow and Boomerang easily accessible and easy to understand. In all,
this is a genius class with appopriate interface.

Hypothetical change:
There we may add more projectils class into this folder to make more items projectible in
the future. And there probabily be more effects abailable in this class, we can implement
more instructions  of those items.
