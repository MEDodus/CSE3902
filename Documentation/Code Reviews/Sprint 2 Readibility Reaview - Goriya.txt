Readibility:
In my view, this class as long as its interface are crystal clear. Methods are 
following the rule of desiging code, as well as the specific logic for moving, addacking
,and etc.  The the case switch for the sprite to turn in different directions
are in the appopriate position for this class, and make it understandable if it is in this class.
There are no suggestions for change in this class. The only change will be if future methods and
functions are added to this class.
