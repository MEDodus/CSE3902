Readability: The code is easy to read and understand, the variable names and the functions names are clear and minimaly but precisely very
			 understandable, it tells the reader what they do. References to other classes that are called in the code are also easily readable, 
			 understandable, and minimally but precisely descriptive.

			 The only thing I would like to suggest is to write some comments before the update function and LinkUsingItemRightState function so 
			 that the reader knows what's happening in the code and why.
