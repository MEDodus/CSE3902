Quality: The code is minimal but good and precise, it doesn't do extra work and is efficient. It is similar to the LinkUsingItemRightState
		 which it is supposed to be and just the direction of the Link is changed, the sprite used looks good, and code is easy to read and understand.
		 The variable names are also understandable and descriptive.

		 Similar to LingUsingItemRightState.cs the only thing I would like to suggest is to write some comments before the update function 
		 and LinkUsingItemLeftState function so that the reader knows what's happening in the code and why.
