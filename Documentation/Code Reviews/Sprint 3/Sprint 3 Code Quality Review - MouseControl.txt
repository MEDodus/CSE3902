Time: 15min.

Code quality:
The code for MouseControl is extremely functional. That being said there isn't much responsibilty to this class (all the better!). Methods are only a
few lines max, and passed parameters do not exceed 4 arguments. In addition only 2 class members are declared. This is high class code!

Hypothetical change:
Potentially switching ExecuteCommands() to include an additional passed HashSet argument. This isn't necessary but it would cut down the Update()
method by one line of code and we need every line cut we can get! Other than that, potential future-proofing... i.e. adding methods to allow 
re-registering commands so, for example, if there was a menu, players could register a button to another command.
