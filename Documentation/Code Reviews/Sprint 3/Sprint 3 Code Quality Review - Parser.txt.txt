Sprint #: 3
Class Reviewed: Parser
Author: Michael Dodus
Time: 23 minutes

Code Quality: 
This class serves as a parser for the CSV files, so it is separate from pretty much everything else in the project.
All of the methods implemented here are pretty short and serve a single purpose, which is good. The class itself
is also pretty short, which is likely due to it being an abstract class with the specific objects being parsed in their
own classes, which is also very good and improved the quality. It keeps this class short and is useful for all the other parsers. 

Hypothetical Change:
A potential change that could be added to this class would be some simple error checking to help determine what went wrong in
a file if there was an error causing it to be unable to be parsed.
