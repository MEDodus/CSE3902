Class Reviewed: Room

Time: 43min.

Code Quality:
This code is very readable and keeps within the suggest class and method lengths. 
The class is cohesive as it solely handles room creation, and each of its methods accomplish one goal.
The code has higher coupling than other classes, but since objects of several types must be present in each room, this can't be avoided.
Overall, this class has very high code quality.

Hypothetical Change:
One possible change would be to split each foreach loop into seperate methods which have a descriptive name as to what the loop is accomplishing.
However, the benefit of improved readability is very small compared to the effort required and increase in class length.
