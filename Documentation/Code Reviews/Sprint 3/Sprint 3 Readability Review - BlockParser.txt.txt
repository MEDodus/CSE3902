Comments on Readability:
I think this class is very readable. The majority of the class is a large switch case, which is long but it is also honestly
pretty easy to understand what is happening in it since the names of everything being parsed is very clear. There are some
HashSets for for all the blocks, collidable blocks, and top layer blocks. Since there are only 3 of these with clear names, it is
easy to identify what they are meant to hold. I think all of the variable names are very easy to read and understand what they are
for. The hardest part of reading this code was the part in the overridden Parse method to draw floors under the doors. Understanding what some
of those numbers were for was somewhat difficult, but the comment helped understand what was happening and it makes more sense because
of that. I think that this is a very readable parser for blocks, helped in some spots by the comments.
