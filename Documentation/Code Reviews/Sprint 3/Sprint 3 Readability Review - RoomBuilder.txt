Comments on Readability: The methods/states in this class are very readable.  The names of variables (CurrentRoom, rooms, etc.) describe exactly
what they contain.  The methods are also descriptive of the jobs they do.  Each method does not do more than what it is described to do.


The only thing that is not very readable are the indices.  The array of rooms is set to 17, 
which could be improved by making it a constant instead of a magic number.  Also, in the method PreviousRoom(),
line 44 (i = i > 0 ? i - 1 : rooms.Length - 1;) is hard to read. While it effectively does it job, the syntax could make it hard for other
programmers not as familiar with C# syntax to understand what it accomplishes.
