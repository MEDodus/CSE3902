Comments on Readability: Great readability in terms of descriptive words to desribe our object. The code only has a constructor, no methods
are provided in this class making it the shortest code I have seen in any of our sprints so far. I'm fought to say whether or not using Settings
class is good or bad. I think for readability it can make it harder to read and understand the parameters that are passed in, but I think I like 
the idea of storing variables that multiple classes will need to access in some static class. Great overall (perhaps change accessing Settings var
iables).
