Sprint #: 4
Class Reviewed: RoomTransitions.cs
Author: Jacob Pohlabel
Time: 43min.

Code Quality:
This code is very readable and keeps within the suggest class and method lengths. 
The class is cohesive as it solely handles room transitions. The classes also do a good job of breaking
up each responsibility into different methods.
The has very low coupling, and efficiently performs room transitions.

Hypothetical Change:
This class could use some more comments as it is performing some complicated actions.
This would greatly improve the readability of the class.

This class could also be improved by generalizing the entrance into the brick dungeons so
it could be applied to other rooms with similar entrances and exits, and not solely "Room17."
