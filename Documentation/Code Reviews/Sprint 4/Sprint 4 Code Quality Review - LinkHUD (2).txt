Code Quality:
This code is pretty good, it's nothing too complicated as it basically instantiates a bunch of HUD elements and then updates/draws them.
There is a lot of repeated logic, such as calling Update and Draw several times which could be simplified. Also, the constructors for 
the HUD elements are a bit messy since they are passed in a lot of positions/vectors/etc. which could possibly be simplified by handling 
the positioning within the classes since the HUD does not really need to know about this. The update functions should also probably not
get passed in link since the standard for all other classes within the project is only to pass in gameTime to Update, you could change this
by passing in a reference to game in the constructor for the HUD elements.

Hypothetical Change:
Store the HUD elements in a data structure of IHUDElement and loop over it to update/draw them.
