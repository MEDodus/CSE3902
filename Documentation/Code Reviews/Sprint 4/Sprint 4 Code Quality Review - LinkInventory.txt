Code Quality:
This inventory system seems to be a very robust inventory system that is designed to hold any object Link has.
I think it has a lot of useful methods that help with the inventory management. It does a good job at doing the
single task of inventory management with items, and not much more. The only things this class uses are items,
which is good since it doesn't need to use much more. Each method also has a very specific task (for example, 
adding/removing items, or finding if they are in the inventory). I like that it can hold every possible item,
not just the useable items (like weapons). I think that overall, the quality of this code is very good since
it has a specific purpose and only does that. I also think most of it is straightforward and is easy to
read/understand.

Hypothetical Change:
I think it could potentially be useful to add how items that are essentially infinite once picked up work
with things such as quantity held, either some more useful comments or more clear code on how that case
is handled.
