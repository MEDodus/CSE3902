Comments on Readability:
This class seems to be pretty short, which makes it relatively easy to read since there isn't a lot to sort through.
I do think that there is alow of text and a lot of calls, which can make it harder to read without taking the time to really look through it.
For example, the return statement in the RequirementsMet method is very long, with three things it is looking to check. This makes sense
due to the nature of the method, but it is still difficult to read, especially since it is just finding three things in the set but has
a lot of new objects created inside of each other (like new Arrow(new Vector2())). The UseEffect method is much more straightforward, 
where you can clearly tell that a Rupy is removed every time an arrow is used (which can only happen when everything is in the inventory).
I think overall, since the class is small, the readability isn't too bad, but does take a little bit to figure out what is going on at first glance.
