Code Readability:
This class is relatively short, especially in term of class member variables.All the methods function as intented and has descriptive names describing
their purpose. Each method relies on one another for reusability, not code is written more than once. The Health class is fairly straightforward just dealing 
with an int variable to keep track of link's health not much more to say on it. I personally am a strong advocate for inline code snippets, I use them quite a
bit so they have gotten easier with time, so if I were to have it my way I'd say use more... though I know most people would probably advise against this haha.

Hypothetical Change:
Change all code to one lines and surpass all programmers.
