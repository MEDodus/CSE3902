Comments on Readability: The methods/states in this class are very readable.  The names of variables (game, decoratedLink, etc.) describe exactly
what they contain.  The methods are also descriptive of the jobs they do (update and draw).


The only thing that is not very readable are the magic numbers. Timer is arbitrarily set to 1.5, and the if statement in update compares it to 0.
The later is not too much of a readability issue, however, the timer variable value could be added to the Settings.cs file as a constant.

Another potential change is exporting the removal of the link decoration class to a separate method with a name such as RemoveWinningState() or 
RemoveLinkDecorator().
