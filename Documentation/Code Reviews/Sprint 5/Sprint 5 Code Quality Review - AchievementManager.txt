Code Quality:
Each method is a good length (<15 lines) and does a good job at keeping the logic simple. This class allows functionality for achievements as well as a save file.
Maybe the functionality for the achievements should be in a different class but utilize the save file for more concise code. However, this is not necessary at the
moment as the save file does need much more functionality other than levels unlocked and achievements unlocked currently. There's not much else to say.

Hypothetical Change:
As with my suggestion above, if we had more than two separate functionalities needed out of save files, using one class to write all logic into a save file might be tedious
and hard for a reader to comprehend, thus, I would suggest refactoring into multiple classes if we were to say store different states of different save files, add save states
for multiple players, or even for reverting to previous save states.
