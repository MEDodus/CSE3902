Class Reviewed: Link1.cs

Time: 38min.

Code Quality:
This code is very readable, although it is longer than the recommended class length. However, this appears
unavoidable due to the amount of functionality in Link.
The class handles many different types of functionality, but all for the Link player, so the class is cohesive.
The class has high coupling as it requires a reference to Game1 and many other classes reference the Link class 
directly.

Hypothetical Change:
This class could break up some of its functionality into helper classes to improve readability. This would decrease
the overall length of the class. Also, instead of having separate Move****() classes, a generalized move class could
accept a Vector and use an Enum to change the facing direction of Link.
