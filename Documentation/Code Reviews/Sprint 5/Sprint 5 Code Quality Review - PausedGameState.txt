Code Quality:
The paused game state seems to be a relatively simple class where the elements on the pause screen are drawn.
It doesn't have too many methods, pretty much just what IGameState has. It is meant to handle certain control events
and drawing when in the paused state. Each method seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do, which is good.
I think the constructor only includes what it needs to create the pause HUD, with every other method handling their own 
tasks. The keyboard direction control methods handle the inventory item selection process. I like the use of the
MoveSelectionUpDown method for Up and Down to avoid repeating code. I wonder if something like this could be done
for Left and Right, since the code seems to be very similar, just going in the opposite direction. I do think the Draw
method is a little long, mainly due to the many if statements to draw specific inventory items. I wonder if there is a
better way to do this, potentially with a loop or something similar.I think that overall, this class is very simple
and the quality of the code is pretty good. It is obvious there was attention to keeping the code clean.


Hypothetical Change:
I think there could be the capability to have more inventory items above the boxed inventory, similar to the actual game.
To do this, it could be useful to change how the inventory draws. Maybe a data structure to hold all the items, which then get
checked in a loop to determine where to draw them. This could also make it easier to add a way to organize the inventory
during runtime if the game were to get to that point by swapping their locations in the data structure.
