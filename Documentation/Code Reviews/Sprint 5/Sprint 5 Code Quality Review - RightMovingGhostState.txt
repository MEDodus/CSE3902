Code quality:
This code is pretty good, there is not too much complex logic and it is pretty clear what the class does.
There are some magic numbers which could maybe get moved to a separate file but this is pretty minor.
There are also some constants which don't seem to be used so they could get removed or moved to any
sub-classes which do use them.

Hypothetical Change:
Clean up the magic numbers
