Comments on Readability:
The length of this class isn't too long and the methods seem to also be pretty short, making it easy to read through the code.
One thing I immediately notice is that right direction methods and RightClick method are all empty. I think a comment in each of
these explaining why this is could help improve the readability and let the reader understand why this is the case without checking
the interface. While reading through the code, it is confusing seeing AchievementManager.IsUnlocked() being called since this is a level
select game state. I think maybe adding a comment to this could help clear that up without the need to look at the AchievementManager.
After knowing what AchievementManager does, it is easy to understand that the code in Draw is simply drawing the buttons depending on if
the next level has been unlocked yet or not. It is also apparent that LeftClick will load the clicked level and switch to that GameState.
I think that overall, this class is pretty readable. There are some things that could be commented to make easier to understand without
looking at other parts of the code, but I think it is mostly fine as it is.
