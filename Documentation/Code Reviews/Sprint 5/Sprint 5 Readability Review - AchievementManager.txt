Comments on Readability: I think this classes readability is quite good overall, method names are descriptive and tell the reader what they do without 
the reader have to look into the code functionality. Genuinely not much to say else, this code is great on the eyes and I could figure out exactly what 
each method was doing (or attempting to do if there are bugs) on first glance.
