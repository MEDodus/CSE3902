Comments on Readability: The methods/states in this class are very readable.  The names of variables (game, decoratedLink, etc.) describe exactly
what they contain.  The methods are also descriptive of the jobs they do (update, draw, MoveUp, etc.).


The only thing that is not very readable are the magic numbers. Timer is arbitrarily set to 48 , and the if statements in update compares it to 0
and its modulus to several undefined numbers.
This could be solved by placing timer variable values in the Settings.cs file as a constant. Or it could be added as a constant to the beginning to the
class.
