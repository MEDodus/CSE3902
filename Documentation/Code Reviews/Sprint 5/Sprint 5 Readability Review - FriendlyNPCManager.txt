Readability:
This code is very readable, it can be easily understood at a glance. Variable and function names are descriptive and clear. 
There is a good deal of commented out code, I'm not sure if you're gonna come back and add more functionality to this class,
but this could probably get removed.

Hypothetical Change:
Remove the commented out sections if you do not need them anymore to further clean up the class.
