Notes:
- When moving between rooms, you have to continue walking through the door to reach the next room, you do not just teleport to the next room.
- The pause menu map does not match the real game, it shows up once you get the map item
- The clock does not pause time yet (will hopefully have this done by presentation)
- The recorder shoots music notes, not sure if this matches original game but it works for this

New features:
- Second dungeon
- Multiplayer (might be a little buggy right now, we will work more on this before the presentation)
- Achievements
- Saving/loading to file (achievements and unlocked dungeons)
- AI escort ghost - when you kill the old man, his ghost follows you around and shoots fireballs at enemies
- Title screen/main menu/achievements screens

Features added that were missing from sprint 4:
- Item swapping
- Enemies dropping items
- Spike cross behavior cleaned up (does not match real game but works pretty well)
- Made more items accessible, such as recorder and magic rod (most of these are found in the second dungeon)
- Fixed enemy appearance clouds not showing up when entering a new room (they originally all showed up when loading level so player did not see them)
- Lots of refactoring/addressing of issues from sprint 3 code feedback
