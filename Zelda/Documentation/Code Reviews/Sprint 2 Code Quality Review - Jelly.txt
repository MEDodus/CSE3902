Comments:
	Highly readable code, code snippets that are commented out which could be removed 
	(depending on whether the current version introduces bugs). Non-implemented methods
	understood in current context, i.e. Attack() method is not implemented because that 
	will be in a future sprint. TakeDamage() method is implemented though, does not have 
	full functionality for this sprint submission. Overall, great readability.
