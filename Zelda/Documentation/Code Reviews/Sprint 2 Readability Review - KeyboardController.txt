Code Quality:
This code is very readable and simple. It simply binds commands to keys and executes those commands whenever the key is pressed.
It could not really get any simpler, it has a clear job and it does it well. There is also a static utility function to check if
multiple keys out of a provided set are being pressed (I wrote this part, Michael wrote the rest), which could maybe get factored 
out into the Link class, but everything that Michael wrote is good.
