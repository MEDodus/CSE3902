Comments on Readability: The methods/states in this class are very readable.  The method names describe exactly what the methods are doing.
In addition, the names of the calls to different classes are easily understandable and descriptive. 

The only thing that is not readable in this code is there are a lot of magic numbers which are not immediately clear what they are referring to.
For example, the currentSprite variable is compared to zero, and incremented or set to zero accordingly.  It might be beneficial if more variables are 
introduced to this class to use constants.
